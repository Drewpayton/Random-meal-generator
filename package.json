  "description": "This is a random filipino meal generator, whenever you load it up it will randomly generate out of 21 meals.\r I used mostly basic css and vanilla javascript to try and improve and define my skills. Some features that\r i would like to add is a page before the random meal pops up and the page has a button that you can click that will take\r you to the random meal.",
